<h4 id="What">What is Lorem Ipsum?</h4>
<p id="Lorem">Lorem Ipsum is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting industry.
  Lorem Ipsum has been the industry's standard<br> the leap into electronic typesetting,
   remaining essentially unchanged.
  It was popularised in the 1960s with the release of Le
</p>
<h4 id="Why">Why do we use it?</h4>
<p id="Itis">It is a long established fact that a reader will be distracted by the readable content of a page when looking at it<!--s layout.
  The point of using Lorem Ipsum is that it has a more-or-less normal distribution of letters, as opposed to using 'Content here, content here', making it--> look like readable English.
  Many desktop publishing packages and web page editors now use Lorem Ipsum as thei<!--r default model text, and a search for 'lorem ipsum' will uncover many web sites still in their infancy.
  Various versions have evolved over the years, sometimes by --><br>accident, sometimes on purpose (injected humour and the like).
</p>
<h4 id="Where">Where does it come from?</h4>
<p id="Contrary">Contrary to popular belief, Lorem Ipsum is not simply random text. It has roots in a piece of classical Latin litera<!--ture from 45 BC, making it over 2000 years old.
  Richard McClintock, a Latin professor at Hampden-Sydney College in Virginia, looked up one of the more obscure --><br>Latin words, consectetur, from a Lorem Ipsum passage,
  and going through the cites of the word in classical lite<!--rature, discovered the undoubtable source.
  Lorem Ipsum comes from sections 1.10.32 and 1.10.33 of "de Finibus Bonorum et Malorum" (The Extremes of Good and --><br>Evil) by Cicero, written in 45 BC. This book is a treatise on the theory of ethics,
  very popular during the Renaissa<!--nce. The first line of Lorem Ipsum, "Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet..", comes from a line in section 1.10.32.--></p>
<br>
<p id="The">The standard chunk of Lorem Ipsum used since the 1500s is reproduced below for those interested.
Sections 1.10.32 an <!--d 1.10.33 from "de Finibus Bonorum et Malorum" by Cicero are also reproduced in their exact original form,
accompanied by English versions from the 1914 translation by H. --><br>Rackham.
</p>
<h4 id="Wherecan">Where can I get some?</h4>
<p id="There">There are many variations of passages of Lorem Ipsum available,
  but the majority have suffered alteration in some form, by injected<!-- humour, or randomised words which don't look even slightly believable.
  If you are going to use a passage of Lorem Ipsum, you need to be sure there isn't anything embarrassing hidden in the--> middle of text.
  All the Lorem Ipsum generators on the Internet tend to repeat predefined chunks as necessary, making this the first tr<!--ue generator on the Internet.
  It uses a dictionary of over 200 Latin words, combined with a handful of model sentence structures, to generate Lorem Ipsum which looks reasonable.
  The generated--> <br>Lorem Ipsum is therefore always free from repetition, injected humour, or non-characteristic words etc.</p>
